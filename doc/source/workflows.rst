The **SWAT** package includes the ability to call **CAS** actions and process the 
output in various ways.  These range from simple (calling **CAS** actions as Python
methods and getting a dictionary of results back) to complex (invoking **CAS**
actions in multiple sessions and handling server responses from them directly).
The various workflows are described in the following sections to give you an idea
of how the classes in **SWAT** interact with each other.
