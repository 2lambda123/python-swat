The SWAT client includes two pieces each of which uses a separate
license.  The Python code is open-sourced and uses the standard
`Apache 2.0 license <http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0>`_.
This code can be used to access CAS using the REST interface only.

To use the binary CAS interface, you also need the SAS TK 
runtime libraries and the Python extensions compiled against
them. These come bundled in the platform-specific installers for
SWAT and are released under SAS' additional functionality license
(shown below).
